For this project, you are required to write 2 Python files and 1 launch file with the
following details:

1. autonomous_exploring.py
2. Project3.launch
3. P3_path_planning.py

*Use turtlebot3_world map for Project 3

Objective for Part(a):
The autonomous_exploring.py when executed will allow the TB3 to autonomously explore the map while avoiding collisions (i.e. similar to turtlebot3_simulation.launch execution)

***Hint: Come out with a simple algorithm first

Objective for Part(b):

(A) The launch file when executed will open the RViz, then run the initial pose node (i.e. initial_pose.py), which enables the TB3 to first initiate the pose estimate for you

(B) And lastly, run the path planning node (i.e. P4_path_planning.py), which enables the TB3 to follow the desired path; the desired path is illustrated in the slides
