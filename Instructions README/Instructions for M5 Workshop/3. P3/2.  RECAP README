[RECAP]:

You have to launch your Gazebo first (to load TB3 in the TB3 World) first before you launch any executable files; e.g. the python file autonomous_exploring.py OR the launch file, Project3.launch

[Example]:

1. Launch Gazebo (to load TB3 in the TB3 World):

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch

2. Execute launch file to execute required tasks:

$ rosrun autonomous autonomous_exploring.py

OR

$ roslaunch autonomous Project3.launch map_file:=$HOME/TB3_WORLD.yaml

*** Meaning you are only required to type 2 command lines on 2 separate terminals to perform the given tasks

*ensure that your python codes are in the src folder of your autonomous package
*ensure that your launch files are in the launch folder of your autonomous package
*ensure you have given permissions to your python files (1. cd to directory; 2. chmod +x P4_path_planning.py)
